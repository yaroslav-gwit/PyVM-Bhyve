# Welcome to the PyVM Bhyve community!
This project was born out of necessity for fast VM deployments on a "not so modern" hardware, be it an old Dell Optiplex PC or a used Lenovo Thinkpad -- you don't always have the means to buy all new and powerful. On one hand you have old and/or cheap hardware, on the other one there is modern and mighty hardware -- PyVM works very well with both.

With help of FreeBSD, ZFS, Bhyve, Cloud Init and a small bit of Python code I was able to achieve an impressive results: VM is deployed from start to end (including SSH keys, IP address, hostname, and any custom deployment scripts) within 10 seconds or less depending on the hardware.

Today project is in use by many for it's portability, reliability and speed (it's a FreeBSD system after all :rocket:)

# Software installation
I will soon publish the code itself and ansible playbooks with instructions on how to deploy everything.
